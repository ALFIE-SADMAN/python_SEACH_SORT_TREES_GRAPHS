# NumPy Practice

This folder contains notebooks and scripts where I practice using **NumPy** for numerical computing in Python.  
NumPy is a powerful library that provides fast, vectorized operations on arrays, along with many built-in mathematical functions.

## Topics Practiced
- Creating and manipulating arrays
- Indexing, slicing, and reshaping
- Mathematical operations (sum, mean, standard deviation, etc.)
- Broadcasting and vectorized computations
- Random number generation
- Linear algebra operations (dot product, matrix multiplication, etc.)

##  Purpose
The goal of this practice is to:
- Build a solid foundation in using NumPy arrays
- Learn efficient ways to handle numerical data
- Prepare for data science and machine learning workflows where NumPy is a core tool
