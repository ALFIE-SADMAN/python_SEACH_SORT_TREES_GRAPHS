# Pandas Practice

This folder contains notebooks and scripts where I practice using **Pandas**, the essential Python library for data manipulation and analysis.  
Pandas makes it easy to work with structured data using **DataFrames** and **Series**.

##  Topics Practiced
- Creating and exploring DataFrames
- Reading and writing data (CSV, Excel, JSON, etc.)
- Indexing, selecting, and filtering data
- Handling missing values
- Grouping and aggregations
- Sorting and ranking
- Merging and joining DataFrames
- Time series data handling

## üõ†Ô∏è Purpose
The goal of this practice is to:
- Develop strong data wrangling and cleaning skills
- Learn how to explore and analyze datasets effectively
- Prepare for real-world applications in data science and machine learning
