# Searching Practice

This folder contains notebooks and scripts where I practice **searching algorithms** in Python.  
Searching algorithms are used to find the location of a target value within a collection of data.

##  Topics Practiced
- **Linear Search**  
  - Simple method, checks elements one by one.
- **Binary Search**  
  - Efficient method for sorted data, divides search space in half.
- **Jump Search**  
  - Uses fixed jumps to speed up searching in sorted arrays.
- **Interpolation Search**  
  - Improves over binary search by estimating the position of the target.
- **Exponential Search**  
  - Efficient for unbounded or infinite lists.

## ðŸ›  Purpose
The goal of this practice is to:
- Learn and compare different searching techniques
- Analyze time complexities of search algorithms
- Build problem-solving skills for competitive programming and interviews
