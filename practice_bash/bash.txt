# Bash Practice

This folder contains scripts and notes where I practice **Bash scripting**.  
Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is a command-line interpreter that allows automation of tasks, file manipulation, and system management.

##  Topics Practiced
- Basic shell commands (ls, cd, pwd, etc.)
- File and directory operations
- Variables and user input
- Conditional statements (if, else, elif)
- Loops (for, while, until)
- Functions in Bash
- Piping and redirection
- Working with permissions
- Writing simple automation scripts

##  Purpose
The goal of this practice is to:
- Strengthen command-line skills
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Learn scripting fundamentals useful for DevOps, system administration, and data pipelines

##  Files
- `hello_world.sh` → First Bash script
- `file_operations.sh` → Creating, moving, and deleting files
- (Add more scripts as you practice)

*This practice is part of my journey to improve scripting and automation skills.*
